This tool was heavily inspired by: https://blog.digitalrickshaw.com/2016/03/14/dumping-the-swift-ast-for-an-ios-project-part-2.html ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Prerequisites

To **build** the tool, you'll need Xcode 14 and macOS 12.5 or greater.

To **install and run** the tool, you'll need Homebrew, Xcode, and macOS 12 or greater.

## Install

```bash
# If you don't have brew installed, install it: https://brew.sh/

# Add the brew tap to your local machine
brew tap veracode/tap

# Install the tool
brew install gen-ir
```

## Update (if previously installed)

```bash
brew upgrade gen-ir
```

## üéâ Done!

All installed! You can now use `gen-ir` on your system - be sure to run `gen-ir --help` to check the available commands and options.

## Usage

> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Before you use
>
>It's important to know that `gen-ir` requires that a **full** build log is provided.
>
>**This means a clean, fresh build of a project.**
>
>The compiler will **not** make a call for an object that doesn't need to be rebuilt, and we will not be able to parse what doesn't exist. Ensure you do a clean before your build otherwise `gen-ir` may miss some modules.

`gen-ir` takes a Xcode build log by two means, a path to a file or stdin:

```bash
# Path to build log (you can export from inside of Xcode too)
xcodebuild clean && \
xcodebuild archive -project TestProject.xcodeproj -scheme TestProject -configuration Debug -destination generic/platform=iOS -archivePath TestProject.xcarchive > build_log.txt

gen-ir build_log.txt TestProject.xcarchive

# Stdin (you may need to redirect stderr to stdout here, Xcode is weird about writing to it sometimes)
xcodebuild clean && \
xcodebuild archive -project TestProject.xcodeproj -scheme TestProject -configuration Debug -destination generic/platform=iOS -archivePath TestProject.xcarchive | gen-ir - TestProject.xcarchive
```

## Building

`gen-ir` is implemented as a Swift Package, so you can either open [`Package.swift`](Package.swift) in Xcode, or build via the command line:

```sh
# Debug output: ./.build/debug/gen-ir
swift build

# Release output: ./.build/release/gen-ir
swift build -c release
```

## Remove older version

If you previously installed the test version during early access testing, run the following commands to remove the test version from your system before installing:

 ```sh
brew uninstall gen-ir &&
brew untap NinjaLikesCheez/tap
```
